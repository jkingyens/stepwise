  "description" : "Almost two years ago I started to include a Hardware section into my Deep Learning presentations.  It was dedicated to a review of the current state and a set of trends for the nearest 1–5+ years. Here is a version from April 2016, and here is an update from October 2017. Last year we saw a lot of interesting announces, I gave some talks with updated slides, and now I am updating it for February/March 2018. I will publish it soon as a separate presentation, and this text(s) will be a companion post(s) to the slides with the goal to make it more readable and useful as a reference. I started to write it as a single post, but it soon became too large, so I decided to split it into a series of bite-sized posts.",
